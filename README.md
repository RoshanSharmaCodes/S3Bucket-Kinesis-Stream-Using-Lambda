## S3Bucket-Kinesis-Stream-Using-Lambda
In this project I have stream lined a process where whenever we put a object [.txt] in S3 Bucket it will execute a lambda function which will streamline it to AWS Kinesis and later Kinesis after streaming it will release it to AWS Lambda and AWS Lambda will give a notification via Email using SNS.
